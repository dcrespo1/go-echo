# Go Echo
- This repo is used for testing/learning about the [labstack/echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) module

## To run the code:
- you can either use [cosmtrek/air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) go utility
- or you can just run main.go

## Routes:

- [/health-check](http://localhost:3000/health-check)
- [/posts](http://localhost:3000/posts)
- [/posts/:id](http://localhost:3000/posts/0)

Currently the data is pulling from a data.json file but eventually id like to explore using SQL/noSQL databases to practice CRUD with go
